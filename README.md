Simply python readability analyzer using the Flesch–Kincaid readability tests

In this basic python project I built an analyzer based on the Flesch–Kincaid  readability scores. I was able to aicheve accurate predictions on samples of Graduate level deep learning papers as well as elementary examples from Dr Seuss books. 

This project allowed me to practice some basic python functions, conditional statements, for loops, and importing modules.
